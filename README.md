## Get started

### Get a local ready copy of LearnHouse

TLDR: Run `docker-compose up -d` and inspect the logs, should be ready to go in less than 2 mins

### Deployment environment

For Docker deployments, keep the live application configuration in `extra/.env`.

- Start from `extra/example-conf.env` and copy it to `extra/.env`.
- The `app` service reads backend runtime configuration from process environment variables only.
- `apps/api/config/config.yaml` is reference-only and is not loaded at runtime.
- `apps/api/.env.example` and `apps/web/.env.example` are local development examples, not deployment
  sources.
- When building with `docker compose`, pass public web build variables with `--env-file extra/.env`
  or exported shell variables because `env_file` does not populate Docker build args.
