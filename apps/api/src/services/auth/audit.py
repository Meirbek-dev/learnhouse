"""Structured audit log for security events.

All writes are append-only. The table is never read during token validation.

Two entry points:
- write_audit_event()     — synchronous; used by sessions.py internals
- enqueue_audit_event()   — returns a callable suitable for FastAPI BackgroundTasks,
                            opening its own short-lived DB session so the response
                            session is not reused after it has been closed.
